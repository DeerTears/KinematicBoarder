My early attempt at making an arcade-style snowboard racing game in Godot Engine.

Preview of gameplay: https://youtu.be/KFiIzLVPQdQ

Goals:
- create a full UI theme for Godot
- publish a 3D game in godot
- have a win state
- align player transform to any surface

This project is primarily abandoned, has a minimal win state, and has some bugs. I may pick it up again someday.

I now know a lot more about 3D physics and how aligning transforms work, so I think when I come back to improve this codebase I will have a lot of improvements to make.
